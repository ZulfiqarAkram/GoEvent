# GoEvent

I made another small ASP.Net MVC 5 application "GoEvent".
GoEvent is an event/party scheduling application.
This time  I am specially focus on coding i.e, Separation of concern, Architecture of application and lot more.

In this application, I implemented some techniques i.e:

 - Separation of concern
 - Repository Pattern,
 - Clean Architecture means (Independent of frameworks,      Independent of UI and Independent of database )
 - Decouple from Entity Framework 
 - Code First Migration 

Code Available Here:    https://github.com/ZulfiqarAkram/GoEvent

 I would greatly appreciate it if you kindly give me some feedback on this application.
 
 Thank you.
